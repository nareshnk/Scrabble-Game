  Class:    ScrabbleWordSuggestor 
  Methods:  Map<Integer, String> generateScoreHash(String rack)
            This method takes as input the rack of letters and generates as output (score,wordlist) pairs.   
            The method uses 
                ArrayList<String> generateAllCombinationsOfWords(String input)
                addToHash(scoreMap,allPossibleWords)
                int wordScore(String word)

  Class:    ScrabbleBlankrackScore
  Methods:  replaceBlanks(String rackAlphabets)
            ArrayList<String> getBlankReplacedWords(String word)
            
            Blank is replaced to get all possible rack alphabets replacing the blanks - returns List(rack words)
            
            
            for each word in the list
              Generate HashScore for all Scrable words possible from the rack alphabet  
              Update the score for each of the words (original score - score of blank replaced alphabet)

  Class:    PositionalConstraintChecker
  Methods:  TreeMap<Integer,String> ConstraintChecker(TreeMap<Integer, String> wordList, String constraint)
            
            Input: A tree map with the score as key and a list of words with the same score as the value, along with a constraint string.
            Output: A tree map with the score as key and only the words that satisfy the positional constraints as the value.
